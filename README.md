# Login Form (React + Vite)

## Overview of Login Form

This project is a login form built with React, SCSS, and the experimental React API — useActionState, which is part of React Server Actions (currently in development in React).

** What does this project demonstrate? **
✅ Usage of useActionState to handle form submission without manually managing useState or useReducer.
✅ Implementation of simple validation logic (for name, email, and password).
✅ User feedback through success or error messages after form submission.
✅ Automatic focus on the name input field when the component mounts.
✅ A responsive UI with a clean design, styled using SCSS.
✅ Inclusion of a React logo for visual identity.
